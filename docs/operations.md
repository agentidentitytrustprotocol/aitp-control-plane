# Operations runbook

Running the control plane in production. Configuration is entirely environment
variables — `.env.example` in the repo is the canonical list, and the internal
[deployment guide](https://github.com/agentidentitytrustprotocol/aitp-control-plane/tree/main/internal_docs)
covers the CI/CD and Railway path. This document explains the operational
subsystems and how to tune them.

## Identity

The CP has its own AITP identity (Ed25519), served at
`/.well-known/aitp-manifest` and used to sign the revocation list.

- **`CP_AID_SEED_HEX`** — 32-byte hex seed. **Required in production.** Without
  it the seed is regenerated on every boot, so the CP's AID changes on restart
  and any peer that pinned the old key breaks. Generate once and store it as a
  secret:
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
  ```
- **`CP_BASE_URL`** — public URL embedded in the CP's own manifest. Set it to
  the externally reachable origin.

Rotating `CP_AID_SEED_HEX` rotates the control-plane identity — treat it like a
signing key, not a config toggle.

## Authentication & exposure

- **`API_KEYS`** — comma-separated allowlist for gated routes. **Required in
  production**: empty `API_KEYS` in prod makes every gated route return
  `503 SERVER_MISCONFIGURED` (fail-safe). Empty in non-prod disables auth and
  logs a one-time warning.
- **`ENROLLMENT_SECRET`** — server-side HMAC key for minting/verifying one-time
  enrollment tokens. Required. Callers never see it.
- **`CORS_ORIGIN`** — allowed browser origin (the UI console's origin). Set it
  to a single origin, e.g. `https://console.example.com`. Applied per-request at
  runtime by the middleware, so it can be changed via the deploy environment
  without rebuilding the image. Defaults to `http://localhost:3000` if unset.

See [`api.md`](api.md#authentication) for the full auth matrix.

## Rate limiting

In-memory, per-process token buckets on every `/api/*` route except the probes
(`/api/health`, `/api/readyz`, `/api/metrics`). Over-limit → `429 RATE_LIMITED`
with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers.

| Bucket | Default | Env var | Keyed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enroll-ip` | 5/min | `RATE_LIMIT_ENROLLMENT_PER_IP_MIN` | client IP (brute-force guard on enrollment) |
| `public-ip` | 60/min | `RATE_LIMIT_PUBLIC_PER_IP_MIN` | client IP |
| `api-key` | 600/min | `RATE_LIMIT_API_KEY_PER_MIN` | API key prefix |

- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` (default 60000) is the accumulation window.
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false` disables the limiter entirely (dev / load tests).
- Set any individual limit to `0` to disable that bucket.

> **Buckets are per-process.** Behind multiple replicas the effective limit is
> roughly `N × limit`. For a hard global limit, put a shared limiter at the edge.

### Client-IP trust (important behind a proxy)

`X-Forwarded-For` is client-controllable, so per-IP buckets are spoofable unless
you tell the CP which hop to trust:

- **`CLIENT_IP_HEADER`** — a single trusted header your edge sets to the real
  client IP (e.g. `cf-connecting-ip`, `x-vercel-forwarded-for`). Wins when set.
- **`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`** — number of trusted proxies appending to XFF; the
  client IP is read this many entries **from the right**. Default `0` = XFF not
  trusted at all (leftmost is spoofable).

Misconfigure these and per-IP limits either bucket every request under one key
or are trivially bypassed. Match them to your actual edge.

## SSE capacity

`GET /api/events/stream` holds an in-process subscription per open stream.

- **`MAX_SSE_CONNECTIONS`** (default 500) caps concurrent streams per process;
  over the cap returns `503 SSE_CAPACITY`. Clients should back off and retry.
- **`MAX_AUDIT_EVENTS_MEMORY`** (default 500) is the in-memory backlog each new
  subscriber replays before going live.

If you front the CP with a fan-out proxy that opens its own upstream pool, raise
`MAX_SSE_CONNECTIONS` accordingly.

## Data retention

A periodic sweep keeps storage bounded. It is multi-instance safe via a Postgres
advisory lock (`pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`), so replicas don't duplicate work.

- **`RETENTION_ENABLED`** (default true) — master switch.
- **`RETENTION_INTERVAL_MS`** (default 1800000 / 30 min) — sweep cadence.
- **`RETENTION_BATCH_LIMIT`** (default 10000) — max rows deleted per sweep, so a
  sweep never locks a table for minutes.

What is swept (set any TTL to `0` to keep that table indefinitely):

| Table | Env var | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `audit_events` | `AUDIT_EVENTS_TTL_DAYS` | 90 |
| `webhook_deliveries` (terminal rows) | `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_TTL_DAYS` | 14 |
| `admin_audit_log` | `ADMIN_AUDIT_TTL_DAYS` | 365 |
| `idempotency_keys` | `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_TTL_DAYS` | 7 |
| `enrollment_jtis` (past expiry) | — | token TTL |
| `agents` with `status='deregistered'` | `EXPIRED_AGENT_GRACE_DAYS` | 30 |

> Despite its name, `EXPIRED_AGENT_GRACE_DAYS` GCs **operator-deregistered**
> agents, not `expired` ones — `expired` rows are left in place so they can be
> re-enrolled. Authoritative records (`revocation_entries`, `issued_tcts`,
> `delegations`, `trust_anchors`, `pinned_keys`) are **never** swept.

## Observability

- **Metrics:** `GET /api/metrics` exposes Prometheus text format (public, exempt
  from rate limiting).
- **Logs:** structured JSON via pino. `LOG_LEVEL` ∈ `trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal`
  (default `info`). Every request/response carries `x-request-id` for correlation.
- **Tracing (OpenTelemetry):** off by default. Set `OTEL_ENABLED=true` to export
  spans to the OTLP HTTP endpoint at `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (path
  `/v1/traces` is appended unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` is set).
  `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` defaults to `aitp-control-plane`. HTTP, `pg`, and `fetch`
  are auto-instrumented.

## Health, readiness & graceful shutdown

- **`GET /api/health`** — liveness + DB ping. Stays `200` even while draining.
- **`GET /api/readyz`** — readiness (DB reachable, identity initialized).

On SIGTERM the process enters a drain window: `/api/readyz` flips to
`503 { "ready": false, "reason": "shutting_down" }` so a load balancer pulls the
pod out of rotation, while `/api/health` stays `200` so the orchestrator doesn't
hard-kill it mid-drain. Point your LB/orchestrator readiness probe at
`/api/readyz` and the liveness probe at `/api/health`.

## Database

- **`DATABASE_URL`** — Postgres connection string (required).
- **`DB_POOL_MAX`** (default 20) — connection pool size.
- Migrations run via `npm run db:migrate` from a checkout; the runtime image
  does not bundle `drizzle-kit`. See the internal
  [deployment guide](https://github.com/agentidentitytrustprotocol/aitp-control-plane/tree/main/internal_docs)
  for the migration step against a hosted database.

## Multi-tenancy

Namespaces (`namespace` column, `X-Aitp-Namespace` header, `?namespace=` filter)
are an **opt-in** scoping convention, not an enforced boundary. `GET
/api/registry/agents` without `?namespace=` returns rows across all tenants by
design — registry discovery is an [operational, non-normative][disc] layer in
AITP, not a protocol-defined isolation boundary. If you need isolation, your
callers must set the namespace on both discovery and enrollment; the CP enforces
no implicit boundary.
